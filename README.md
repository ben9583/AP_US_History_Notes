# AP US History Notes
### Ben Plate
### 2018-2019

Here you can find my notes taken in AP US History from August 13th and on.
You will notice there are two file formats, PDF and Pages, which you can find more information about below.


#### PDF
PDF Files can be read by most computers and are optimal for read-only documents. However, they can't be edited as they are just a series of images with no raw data.

#### Pages
Pages files are opened by the Pages application [available for mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id409201541?mt=12&ls=1) and on iCloud.com for PC. It is a rich text word processor created by Apple that allows for flexible editing of text and images. The app isn't available for download on Windows but has raw data that can be edited (making it a larger file), making for a quality read-edit document.
